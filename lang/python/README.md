# python — Python 3, written for Braam

Not a port. Every other program in this tree is somebody else's source with the
lines that touch the OS replaced; this one is a Python implementation written
from nothing — its own lexer, its own parser, its own compiler, its own
bytecode and its own virtual machine.

One thing is borrowed, and it is the reason the rest can be trusted:
**MicroPython's test suite**. It is the best executable specification of the
language at this size, it is MIT, and a test in it either matches CPython byte
for byte or says in an `.exp` file what it expects instead. The copies that
`make test` runs are under [test/cases/](test/), with their provenance in
[test/manifest.txt](test/manifest.txt); the upstream clone they came from sits
in `tmp/` and is not committed.

```
$ python --version
Python 0.1 on Braam
```

## Status

**Phase 6 of ten. It runs.**

```
$ python -c 'print(sum([i * i for i in range(10)]))'
285
```

Expressions, `if`, `while`, `for`, comprehensions, `def` with the whole
argument grammar, closures, slicing, unpacking, eighteen builtins, `sys.argv`
and a traceback on the way out. Seventeen of MicroPython's own tests pass
unchanged. What is not here: **exceptions** (phase 7), **classes** (phase 9),
generators and the methods on the built-in types — so `try`, `class`, `yield`
and `"".format` each stop with a message that says so.

`python --dump-tokens f.py`, `python --dump-ast f.py` and `python --dis f.py`
print what the lexer, the parser and the compiler produced; the first two are
checked against CPython's own `tokenize` and `ast` modules, and the third
against goldens of its own, the bytecode being ours.

[TODO.md](TODO.md) is the plan: the ground rules the design is pinned to, the
ten phases, and the upstream tests each one is expected to turn green.

The table grows a row per phase.

## Why every root is explicit

Conservative stack scanning has no mechanism on this target: there is no
`__builtin_frame_address`, no exported stack base, and wasm keeps pointers in
locals that a scan of linear memory cannot see. So the collector is precise and
every root is named — and C++ that holds an object across an allocation has to
pin it:

    Root s{ obj_value(str_new("x")) };   // survives the tuple below
    TupleObj *t = tuple_new(1);

Forget the `Root` and the string is freed under you. `--selftest`'s `stress`
check is there to catch exactly that: it collects at *every* allocation, so a
missing pin becomes a wrong object count rather than a rare crash. A whole
Python program can be run the same way:

    PY_GC_STRESS=1 python prog.py

which is slow and is the point — [test/pyvm.mjs](test/pyvm.mjs) drives one
program through it every run.

Inside the VM the discipline takes a second form, because the value stack is
already a root: an operand is read *where it lies*, the result computed, and
only then is `sp` moved. Popping first and computing after would leave the
operands unreachable across the allocation that the operation itself makes.

## Why the bytecode has no exception table

CPython 3.11 moved exception handling to a side table and made the happy path
free. This does not: `SetupFinally` pushes a handler, `PopBlock` pops it, and
the VM cuts the value stack back to the depth the block recorded. The 3.10
shape is what a first VM can be written against and read, and it is what the
opcode comments in [code.h](code.h) state exactly.

What is *not* in the block stack is loops. A `break`, a `continue` or a
`return` that leaves a `try`/`finally` or a `with` emits that cleanup inline
before it jumps, which is what CPython has done since 3.9 — so the only thing
the VM has to unwind at run time is an exception.

## Known differences from CPython

All recorded rather than hidden, and all in reach later:

- **A set iterates in insertion order.** CPython's order falls out of its hash
  table's size and probing, and matching it exactly would mean copying that
  table. Anything that prints a set directly will differ; anything that prints
  `sorted(s)` will not.
- **`repr` of a string keeps every codepoint from U+00A0 up as itself.**
  CPython escapes the ones Unicode calls unprintable, which needs a
  printability table this does not carry yet.
- **An identifier may hold any codepoint from U+0080 up.** CPython follows
  Unicode's XID_Start and XID_Continue, which is another table. So this accepts
  some names CPython rejects, and rejects none it accepts.
- **An f-string is one node holding its body as written.** What is inside the
  braces is parsed in a later phase; CPython builds a `JoinedStr` here, and the
  compiler refuses one rather than pretending.
- **An annotation is neither evaluated nor recorded.** `x: int = 1` compiles as
  `x = 1`, and a parameter annotation costs nothing at `def` time. CPython
  evaluates both and keeps `__annotations__`.
- **`async` is refused by the compiler.** The parser accepts the whole 3.9
  grammar; `async def`, `async for`, `async with` and `await` stop at the
  compiler with a `SyntaxError` that says so.
- **The built-in types have no methods yet.** `[].append`, `{}.keys` and
  `"".format` are an `AttributeError`; the eighteen builtins and the operators
  are the whole surface. They arrive with the rest of the standard library.
- **`import` finds only built-in modules**, which is `sys` and nothing else.
  There is no search path until there is a module object worth loading into.

## Why the VM is a driver

A `co_await` is a call and not a tail call: the wasm tail-call feature is off,
so entering a task and returning from it each leave a frame on the native
stack, given back only where something *suspends*. An interpreter loop that
awaited would therefore grow the stack until the process trapped.

So the VM is plain C++ that runs until it has something for its caller to do —
a read, a write, an open, an exit — and returns saying what. Only
[braam.cpp](braam.cpp) awaits. It is the shape
[emulators/simbesm](../../emulators/simbesm/) arrived at for the same reason,
and it decides much else: a Python call pushes a frame rather than recursing,
and an error is a sticky flag unwound a frame at a time, because there is no
`setjmp` here either.

The whole of the driver is eleven lines:

    for (;;) {
        Req r = vm_burst();
        if (r.kind == ReqKind::Exit)
            co_return r.status;
        vm_write_done(!(co_await write_all(r.fd, r.data)).is_err());
    }

`print` therefore does not write. It appends to a buffer the VM owns, and the
VM asks for one write when that buffer passes four kilobytes or the program
ends — which is also why a syscall per `print` never happens.

Because frames are heap objects rather than C++ ones, the recursion limit is
ours to choose and ours to *report*: two hundred deep is a `RecursionError`
with a traceback, not a trap.

## Testing

`make test` from the top of the tree runs everything; one file at a time:

    make test TESTS=lang/python/test/pysmoke.mjs

All three need node and a built `../braam-core`. To bring one more upstream
test into the suite:

    tools/mkexp.py basics/andor.py

which copies it into `test/cases/`, writes the expected output beside it —
upstream's own `.exp` when there is one, host CPython otherwise — and adds a
row to the manifest marked `fail`. Move the row to `pass` when it passes.

A new tokenizer or parser case is a `.py` under `test/lex/` or `test/ast/`
plus

    tools/mklex.py test/lex/<name>.py
    tools/mkast.py test/ast/<name>.py

which write the golden from CPython's own `tokenize` and `ast` modules, so both
are measured against CPython rather than against themselves. A case whose name
ends in `_err` is one that must be refused, and its golden holds the complaint;
`node test/pylex.mjs --bless` and `node test/pyast.mjs --bless` rewrite those,
after reading the diff.

A compiler case is a `.py` under `test/dis/` and nothing else: the bytecode is
this implementation's, so there is nothing to generate the golden from and
`node test/pydis.mjs --bless` writes what the compiler printed. **Read the diff
before blessing** — that golden is the only thing standing between a change and
a silent regression.
